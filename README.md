## Usage

[Workout Tracker](https://warm-gorge-51596.herokuapp.com/)

The homepage of the application will present details of the most recent workout to the user, allowing them to continue adding exercises to that workout. If no workouts have been started or the user wishes to start a new workout, they may do so. In either case, the user is given the option to record one or more exercises to associate with the current workout. There is also a "Dashboard" navigation option that allows the user to view charts that provide a visual summarization of their 7 most recent workouts.
